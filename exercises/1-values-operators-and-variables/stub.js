// COMMENTS
// ******************************************************************
//

// This is how you write comments.

/*
You can also write multi-line comments, like this.
It's good for long sections of text, since you don't have to keep
adding // to the beginning of every line.
*/


//
// TEXT AND NUMBERS
// ******************************************************************
//

// Let's start with the basics. Strings (which is just text),
// numbers, and booleans (true or false).

1;

// The quotes tell Javascript that what is being typed is in fact a
// text. The following three statements are strings, not numbers or
// booleans.

2;


//
// OPERATORS
// ******************************************************************
//

// We can do interesting things with our data, such as math,
// modifying the text, and much more. Below are some basic examples.
// These are called operators.

3;

// There are also operators for comparing two values. These always
// output a boolean.

4;


//
// VARIABLES
// ******************************************************************
//

// We can store these in so-called "variables". A variable stores a
// value, and is given its own name.

5;

// We can also leave them unassigned.

6;

// Variables can be named anything, but it's recommended
// toNameThemLikeThis, and to not use any special characters.

7;

// Variables can be changed at any time.

8;

// You can always refer to variables in places that expect data of
// that type. They can also refer to themselves.

9;


//
// OUTPUTTING
// ******************************************************************
//

// OK, so this is all good, but worthless on its own. How do we get
// our code to put something on the screen? The simplest way of doing
// this is calling the function console.log(). This will spit out
// your data to the console.
