// We have been using "console.log()" quite a bit so far. This is a
// function. Functions are bits of code that can be called over and over,
// without having to write the same thing multiple times. A function may

// function.

// We can now call our brand new function.

2;

// Let's turn the for loop from the last exercise into a function.

// Values have their own functions as well. Strings have the slice()
// function, which returns a section of the string. We also use the
// Number() function to convert the string to a number, getting rid of
// extra leading zeroes.

// We can also nest functions inside other functions
